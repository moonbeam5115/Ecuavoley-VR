The characters were created using Adobe Fuse. The animations were made using a mixture of Mixamo and Blender.  
Textures have been collected from various open source locations.  
  
GUI Elements have been incorporated to help with serving - location, height, and power controls.

Animations have been linked to character objects via C# scripts. Physics equations have also been implemented  
and a scoring system is currently in the works. Future work includes adding AI to non-playable characters as  
well as networking for multiplayer functionality.
